Hello,

please note that randomiser.exe must be in the same directory as the game exe when it is being run,
otherwise, silly stuff will happen.

randomiser is our own built executable that provides random locations for the code, therefore,
it is required for the code to operate properly.

On the other hand, with just 3 lines of code, you can completely remove the reliance on 
randomiser which in case, the bot will start always at position [0,0].

PS: if you run the game executable and see a fatal error, "failed to execute script randomiser"
ignore the message and run again until it works (its a windows problem).

Thats all...
